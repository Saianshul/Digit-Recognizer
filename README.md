# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

## Introduction

#### In this project, we have developed a Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes classifier from scratch to classify the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. We have also created a website where users can easily try out the Python model as our deliverable.

#### Our model is based on Bayesian statistics, which views probabilities as uncertain values that can be altered when new evidence is revealed (this is where the idea of conditional probabilities originates from). This differs from Frequentist statistics, which conversely views probabilities as fixed values based on the long-run relative frequency of an event occurring over repeated trials. The formula for Bayes Theorem can be seen below:
